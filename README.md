This Big Data Project project is based on the paper entitled [a link]([https://github.com/user/repo/blob/branch/other_file.md](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350121721_A_Data-Driven_Approach_for_Video_Game_Playability_Analysis_Based_on_Players%27_Reviews)) in this case study, the definition of playability analyzed consists of three basic concepts "functionality, usability, and gameplay" defined by the framework of Paavilainen.
The goal is to obtain an explicit and simplified framework so that not only the intuitively quantified assessment of the overall playability of the chosen game is obtained but also to analyze and be able to view the positive and negative aspects of it, and while classifying the information that can be "playability-informative" and "non-playability-informative" divided into the classes listed above.
